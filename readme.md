[Screen Shot of website](railway.png)


Hy devs I created a Railway Reservation website using pug,nodejs and CSS/Bootstrap.
This website is a prototype of here you can book tickets, cancel tickets, get train status, and download your receipt any time. unique ID is given to every one and through this they can book or cancel booked tickets and download their receipt.

Styling of this website is very simple basic. You can contibute to it and design it.

Basically it is my node.js project so, I have focused only on the backend.

Hope you like it....
